Common issues for hierarchical aggolomerative clustering (HAC):
1. start from bottom to top
2. at the beginning, each element is a cluster
3. each time, merge two clusters to be one cluster based on some criterion
4. finally, only one cluster that contains all of the elements
5. distance between two clusters: a. minimum; b. maximum; c. mean or centroid; d. average
6. criteria for merge selection: the least, or comparison
